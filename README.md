# Hotel Data Analysis

### In this analysis I migrated data from Microsoft Excel to SQL Server and Power BI in order to allow database querying. I also utilized a built-in SQL operator (UNION) to create a temp table in order to conveniently access all of the hotel data at once. Additionally, I used Power BI tools to create a data visualization in order to provide insight to the questions of: 
##### Is the hotelâ€™s revenue increasing year to year?
##### Is there adequate parking arrangements for guest?


The displays below show the results of the queries in multiple forms:
